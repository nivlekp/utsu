# Things TODO

[ ] Accomodate octava / write the notename explicitly

[ ] Experiment with differenet q-grid

[ ] Accomodate multiple servers in a cloud in the `make_cloud` function

[ ] Proportional duration

[ ] Concat all the segments

[ ] System too close together (sometimes)

[ ] Maybe consider changing to protrait instead of landscape (system changes more work on eyes)

[ ] Check note grouping (measure 2, 14, 18 of segment a)

[ ] fix grace note to rest
