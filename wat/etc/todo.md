# Things TODO

[x] Accomodate octava / write the notename explicitly

[x] Experiment with differenet q-grid

[-] Accomodate multiple servers in a cloud in the `make_cloud` function

[ ] Proportional duration

[x] Concat all the segments

[ ] System too close together (sometimes)

[ ] Maybe consider changing to protrait instead of landscape (system changes more work on eyes)

[ ] Check note grouping (measure 2, 14, 18 of segment a)

[x] fix grace note to rest
